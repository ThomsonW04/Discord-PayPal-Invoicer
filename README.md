This is an incomplete middle man to bridge PayPals API with Discord API.

The bot aims at creating and sending invoices for selling products via Discord. This also can be used to check the status of the invoice, wether its paid etc.

This is no longer in development and may no longer work.

A new version will be developed, for the moment an API wrapper is being build https://github.com/ThomsonW04/PayPal-Invoice-API-Wrapper this may link to related projects in the future, however this is now publicly archived.
